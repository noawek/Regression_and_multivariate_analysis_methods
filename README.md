# Regression and Multivariate Analysis Methods - Final Project 📊📚
Welcome to the repository for my final project in the Regression and Multivariate Analysis Methods course! This project showcases my ability to apply advanced statistical techniques and regression models using R to analyze complex datasets, demonstrating the skills and methods I acquired during the course.

Project Overview 🔍

The objective of this project was to analyze a dataset using various regression and multivariate analysis techniques to uncover meaningful relationships and insights, and it reflects my understanding of statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and interpretation of results in real-world contexts. The project involved analyzing a dataset to explore the relationships between personality traits, situational factors, and movie ratings. Using regression models, I tested various hypotheses, performed statistical analyses, and interpreted the results to draw meaningful conclusions.

Key Focus Areas:
- Applying linear and non-linear regression models.
- Exploring multivariate relationships between variables.
- Evaluating model performance and diagnostics.

Key Highlights 📈
- Data Preparation: Cleaned, transformed, and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- Regression Models: Applied multiple regression techniques, including:
   - Linear regression.
   - Logistic regression.
   - Multivariate regression.
- Multivariate Analysis: Explored methods such as PCA, factor analysis, and clustering.
- Results: Insights into the data were supported by clear statistical evidence and visualizations.

Skills and Tools Used 🛠️
- R Programming: Leveraged for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.
- Statistical Techniques: Regression analysis, multivariate analysis methods, and model evaluation.
- Data Visualization: Created clear and informative visualizations using R packages like ggplot2.
